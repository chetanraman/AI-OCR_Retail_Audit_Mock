# AI-OCR Retail Audit Workflow (Mock Project)

## 🧩 Problem

Retail deployment audits are often manual, slow, and error-prone. Verifying fixture installations across thousands of stores consumes valuable time and creates compliance risks.

## 🚀 Solution

This mock project outlines an AI-driven OCR workflow to automate fixture validation during store tech deployments.

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. **Input:** Store fixture image or scanned installation form  
2. **OCR Layer:** Extract serial numbers, barcodes, or metadata using Tesseract  
3. **GenAI Layer:** Validate against planned deployment configs (mocked with rule-based logic or OpenAI API)  
4. **Workflow Engine:** Route pass/fail results via Pega (or BPM tool)  
5. **Dashboard:** Aggregate audit KPIs (mocked via Tableau or Power BI)

## 🛠️ Tools Referenced

- [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)  
- OpenAI GPT-4 (or rule engine mock)  
- Pega BPM (conceptual)  
- Tableau / Power BI (dashboarding)

## 📈 Business Impact (Modeled)

- Reduce audit cycle time by **40%**  
- Eliminate manual errors across **15,000+ deployments/year**  
- Enable **real-time compliance tracking** across 9 global regions

## 💡 Why This Project

This repo demonstrates how AI, OCR, and automation principles can be applied in enterprise deployment workflows — drawing from my experience leading Apple Retail deployment programs as a consultant at Infosys.
