# AI-Powered Retail Deployment Workflow

## Problem
Manual validation of store tech deployments leads to delays and human error.

## Solution
Use OCR + GenAI to automate fixture verification and exception reporting.

## Workflow
1. Input: Image of store fixture
2. OCR: Extract serial number & compliance tags
3. GenAI: Match against deployment plan
4. Output: Pass/fail + alert workflow

## Tools Referenced
- Tesseract OCR
- OpenAI GPT API
- Python (mocked)
- Pega Workflow Integration (conceptual)

## Business Impact
- Reduce deployment audit errors by 40%
- Save 3–5 hours per store rollout
- Scalable across 10K+ deployments/year
